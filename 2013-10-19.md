Office hours with Aaron from 11 - 1 pm

####Data Curation:

* Could not get Aaron's code to run, realized that we have to install panda first with sudo get-apt install python-panda
* Tried to read new data using JSON but could not get the new data into a usable format
* Discussed JSON with Aaron, suggested that we move on to caching the data from his csv file
* However, after looking at the issue tracker and reading more about JSON, group was able to format the new data into a data frame
* Discussed data caching with Aaron to get a better understanding of the goal of the assignment
* Worked with horizontal group members on data caching
* Used to_csv to save the data and wrote code so that the cached data would be named with the date
* Struggled with figuring out how to use git push to save the cached data to our repository
* Read about git commands online and figured out how to use git clone, git add, git commit, and git push
